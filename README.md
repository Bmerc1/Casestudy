PayPal is an online financial service that allows you to pay for items using a secure internet account.

PayPal was Founded in 1998  by Ken Howery, Luke Nosek, Max Levchin and Peter Thiel. Originally this Californian company was registered as Confinity inc. (a combination of confidence and infinity) however, this changed to be known as PayPal in 2001 when merged with Elon Musk’s X.com.

In the early 1990s, sending and receiving payments online between individuals was not an easy process. The company aimed to provide secure software for financial transactions on individually owned devices. PayPal smartly targeted an underserved market as the internet tightened its grip on global consumers: Banking and payments. 

The idea of the founders was simple and efficient. It set out to convince customers to share their email, banking and credit card information in return for fast, low-cost payments. 

When PayPal officially launched in 2000, it gained rapid success. This was mainly due to using referrals and small charges for signing up.  After watching PayPal become the premier choice of Internet auctions such as eBay and parallel to achieveing 200 million users accounts worldwide, interim CEO Peter Thiel sought to seek a buyer. Setting the minimum at $600 million dollars, both Google and Yahoo denied. The company then prepared for an IPO and was valued by the market at $1.2 billion.  After several weeks of negotiation eBay acquired PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion, a sustainable amount more than its original $400 million dollar offer.  

In late 2014, PayPal spilt from eBay. Both companies President and CEO John Donahoe cited  “As separate, independent companies, eBay, led by Devin Wenig, and PayPal, led by Dan Schulman, will each have a sharper focus and greater flexibility to pursue future success in their respective global commerce and payments markets. I am confident that eBay and PayPal each have the right leadership team, strategy, structure and operational discipline to create sustainable, long-term value for stockholders and deliver great opportunities and experiences for customers worldwide.”

Fast foward to finacial year 2020 PayPal saw a total payment volume (TPV) of $936 billion, growing 31% on a spot and FXN basis. An approximate $5.9 billion in Operating Cash Flow and around $5.0 billion in Free Cash Flow and an added 72.2 million Net New Active Accounts. 

The below graphs illustrate the most recent success of PayPal.
